# Introduction

The **Beta Distribution** is a family of continuous probability distribution defined on the interval $[0,1]$ in terms of two positive parameters , denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$, that appear as exponents of the variable and its complement to 1,respectively, and control the shape of the distribution.
